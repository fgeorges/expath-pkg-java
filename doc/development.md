# Development

This file documents the development process and cycles for this
project, how to contribute through Git, and how to use the Maven build
process.


## Source repository

The source repository is on GitHub, at
http://github.com/fgeorges/expath-pkg-java.  This section still has to
be detailed, but you can have a look at the good explanations about
how to use GitHub from the eXist database project, at
http://github.com/eXist-db/exist.


## Build process

The build process is based on Maven.  The typical tasks whilst
developing are:

- building the project locally
- adding new unit tests
- run test suites
- building the project to be released

TODO: This has still to be documented, especially how to set the
version number for the build (either to reflect this is a development
build or to set the release number in case of an actual release).
